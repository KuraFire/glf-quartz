What if our world doesn‚Äôt have to be so scary.

What if we can change it?

All of us having actual, meaningful control over our fate.

[[I Want To Make A (‚Ä¢) Difference In The World]]. 

A Love First Idea: [[The JEDI Knights of Cydonia]] playlist


## Set Your Controls

To accept this mission
Set your control points




I (Don‚Äôt) Want This To Define My Fate


## My Control Point Is ‚Ä¢

- üåÄ 1: Mars
- üåÄ 1: Faruk

The offer:
1. Who ‚Ä¢ What is Ayreon?
2. üåÄ 1: If Arjen ever wants to use French Horn on one of his albums
3. Earth One: This Is My Offer To You
4. (Concerns) Mars:, they accelerated you (‚Ä¢ boomerang of love‚Ä¢) *again*
5. üåÄ 1: Everything Is Everything (In My Head)


This is a story about Faruk Rainbow Dragon Supernova


(This Is: a [[People/Supernova/stubs/index|Supernova Stub]])

Context Matters:
1. Me telling the Love First origin story to Mars
2. Us watching Stranger Than Fiction


I am (The Protagonist ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ For Now)

This is my plan:

Break The Fourth Wall
Made With Love First
Context Matters

Love First Day

Big Hero 6

His Timepiece Changed Everything

I‚Äôm The (Omniscient) Narrator

And This Is Just The Prologue

A (Love) Catalyst to An Entirely New Life

- [ ] (Rewatch STF)

Introduce someone you love to a movie you love %% (while high) %%


Why I think (‚Ä¢ A Group Identity ‚Ä¢) Can Save Us



In Love First:
- You Don‚Äôt Have Suicidal Ideation, You‚Äôre Just Trying To Figure Out How To Kill Off A Character In Your Own Story

I read this in ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ this fantastically (depressing) book



My offer:
If you work with me closely, you‚Äôll find yourself frequently saying or thinking: ‚ÄúI find it surprisingly easy to do this thing that I‚Äôve never done my entire lif[[I‚Äôm Going Love First; Here‚Äôs What That Means]] offer community and identity coaching. [[I‚Äôm Going Love First; Here‚Äôs What That Means]].



I want (a):
- Queen Latifah From Stranger Than Fiction
In my life

Maybe we should use some different language about how to convince everyone of their imminent death

Because some people may have an understandable tendency to get really angry when they feel like they might be about to die (All. The. Time.)


I am (this character) in my own life

What if what I‚Äôm saying is true:
My World In 2040
Our Better World In 2040


To learn about love:
Go see an expert about love
Go see a Love Catalyst


My challenge to people with opposing views:
- I write how and why I Think YOU feel
- You write how


(Little Did He Know)

I want to give an entire seminar about:
- üåÄ 1: Own Your Actions

MWLF
My MWLF technique for when I do seminars and workshops:

If I use a quote from something, like from STF:
I left my socialist reading material at home
(‚Ä¶because someone started complaining about socialism in the middle of my facilitation and it‚Äôs not the topic of concern)

The meaning of a statement can make quite a difference 

I want to practice making myself extremely useful (to ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ for) other people


The only way to find out what story you‚Äôre in is to:
- eliminate what stories you‚Äôre NOT in
- AND
- write it out yourself 

Do you have magical powers?
Yes

Are we making a comedy or a tragedy?

(Develop That)


You had a little portal there?

How I want to make the world a better place with my vision of love first

Dear billionaires: the plot is coming to you

Consent Puzzle: Solved! (For Now)
(See image: my puzzle page, multi-dimensional storytelling)

A Bible But With Version Control


I want to satisfy your consciousness with the cases I make


The Harmony System: an explicit social contract for a more harmonious world


A Love First experiment:
Watch Big Hero 6 on Dec 17th
Declare rock bottom on Dec 18th and envision a new reality‚Äîtogether or on your own

Let‚Äôs write a better story for all of us

Rule #1: You Do (Not) Talk About Write Club

1. I will write the blueprint which each ‚Äúessay‚Äù‚Äîregardless of its medium‚Äîis to be modeled on, at least to start
2. This equalizes the playing field a little (not that it matters) and, more importantly, it makes for a bench line or set of metrics by which we can assess it
3. The prompt is: who can write the most loving picture of a possible future for us
4. Let‚Äôs see if we can get this spaceship earth back on a more agreeable course for everyone



## The Less Famous Experiment Of *Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cup*

I had a moth (not a regular one?) and a tiny spider both show up in my bathroom at the exact same time. The reason they showed up so perfectly simultaneously is that‚Ä¶ that was when I turned on the light.

‚ÄúGreat, two new unwanted roommates. At least one is here to take care of the other, though.‚Äù

I contemplated what to do, and ultimately decided to nudge nature‚Äôs hand. I put a clear cup over the moth, ushered the tiny spider onto a small piece of toilet paper, and put the cup‚Äîwith fly!‚Äîon top of it.

The fly is slightly larger than the spider, yet, who will eat whom? Until I go back in to check, they are both equally dead and alive to me.


## The Wake Does Not Determine The Boat‚Äôs Course

If I throw a ball in the air and carefully observe where it lands, and then I pick it up and throw the ball in the exact same way from the exact same position using the exact same hand motion, angle, velocity, and energy as I did on the first throw‚Ä¶

Would the ball land in the exact same place?

The only true answer is you can‚Äôt predict that with certainty, because the prompt does not specify sufficient context or constraints for the experiment. I could throw it identically, but then I could snag it out of the air or swat it away before it hit the ground.

We can change our minds any time we want to, and anytime we feel we *need* to, and we can radically alter the course of a trajectory. You can suddenly turn the wheel or rudder on the boat. You can snag the ball out of the air. [[You Can Change Your Mind. On anything. On *Everything*.]]

We can interfere with nature‚Äôs course; how ‚Äòbout we try some more/new/different ways to interfere with it for positive impact?


## I want to offer [[Community & Identity Coaching]]
(What does that mean?)

Community ‚Üí potluck salons on a topic with leaders and interested parties from the community

(Mars‚Äôs song circle, me chiming in with the five stages of mastery)

The stage of conscious incompetence SUCKS

I‚Äôm starting to see where my competency has become conscious, and perhaps even unconscious, with Love First. Things are starting to flow more freely.
