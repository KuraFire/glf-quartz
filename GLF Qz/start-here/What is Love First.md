Love First is [[An Idea]], [[A Way of Life]], [[A Framework]], A Shared Identity, A Movement, and more. With it being an umbrella term encapsulating so many things, it’s hard to pin down or explain simply! 

As an **Idea**, Love First teaches that with all we have discovered, learned, and invented, the best foundation for us to heal the world’s pain and overcome our collective challenges, is the philosophy of _Universal Love_. It offers us a lens through which we can channel our thoughts, words, and actions, and create beautiful, powerful, even miraculous results.

As a **Way of Life**, Love First invites us to embody living by the values, principles, and practices it offers, implementing them in all areas of our lives as best we can. To embrace it as a way of life is known as *Going Love First* (hence the name of this site).
