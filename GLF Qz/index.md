# Welcome to Love First
## A philosophy for a life lived fully, authentically, and chock full of love

**What if every moment of your life, every experience, was guided gently by all of the wisdom and love this universe holds for you?** Imagine waking up each day with the joy and comfort of knowing that you are on the path to becoming your highest self, and everything and everyone around you is conspiring to help you. Imagine feeling such deep trust that the universe will provide, you feel it in your bones that you live a life of abundance and perpetual growth. Imagine you’re just flowing smoothly in a river of pure, cosmic love.

That’s what is called *Cosmic Flow State*, and Love First is your path to get there.

## What is Love First?

<nobr>Love First</nobr> is a framework for transforming your reality in a way that benefits all areas of your life, making you feel more connected to your best self, your loved ones, and the world around you. 

Love First brings together ancient wisdom with cutting-edge science from fields like flow state, neurolinguistic programming, mindfulness, psychology and more, to create a holistic way of being that helps you get attuned to the magic and mysteries of the universe. And even if you’re not into spiritual stuff, or think this is a little “woo” for you, the evidence-based practices and teachings will help you elevate your life to the next level all the same.

## Our world kinda sucks (but it doesn’t have to)

Creating a better world begins by improving the world within.

But why not do both at the same time?

Love First goes beyond just *personal* development, as your journey will also support the larger needs of this world. As part of a shared journey, _Going Love First_ means being part of something greater than yourself, alongside people working not just to *be* their best selves, but to make ours the best world it can be—together.

## This journey has only just begun
