# Supernova Bursts

The items below are *Supernova Bursts*,  notes that contain a large number of stubs, titles or unfinished thoughts and ideas that are wanting to be fleshed out and refined. On their own these Bursts probably only make sense to [[people/supernova/index|index]] and, to lesser extent, whoever else is mentioned in it or was present during its creation. Some are published nonetheless in the spirit of radical transparency, to showcase the (chaotic) process behind the art.

If a phrase has Multiple Title Cased Word In It, it means itâ€™s definitely a planned note, page, essay, or piece of the Love First framework. Other phrases may represent bigger ideas, but might also belong to a bigger idea above them.

## How this works

Supernova Bursts are the beginnings, or roots, of many (much) bigger ideas waiting to be fleshed out into their own essays or pages. The [[Love First Writing Experiment]] invites people to donate small dollar amounts to crowd-fund the creation of Pieces that they are most keen to learn more from. 

Currently, Pieces are put at the top of the to-write pile when donations for them pass the threshold of <nobr>$55</nobr>.  

For more information, see the [[to-write|To Write Pile]].
