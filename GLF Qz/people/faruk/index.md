# Faruk Ateş

Hello, my name is Faruk Rainbow Dragon [[people/supernova/index|Supernova]], and you can call me by any of them. You’ll get a different side of me depending on which you use.

I am a [[Love First Person]]. This means I explicitly identify as someone who wishes to see a better world made for all of humanity, a world made with love: for ourselves, each other, all others, animals, and the planet itself. A world made with love at the heart of all of our principles, values, actions, and policies. It’s a way of wearing my heart on my sleeve, inviting everyone to do the same.

Professionally, I am a Love Catalyst, the Principal Storyteller of Love First (for now), and a transformational coach, facilitator, and public speaker. I’m also a recovering software engineer, product designer, and startup founder. Additionally, I’m a writer, performance artist, poet, technologist, and storyteller.
