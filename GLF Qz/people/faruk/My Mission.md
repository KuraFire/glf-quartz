# My Mission, My North Star 

The meaning of life is to give life meaning. That is a unique proposition for every person, but I believe that Love is at the heart of every person’s perspective of a meaningful life (for them). <q>Everything comes down to love; love, or the lack of it.</q> (Fred Rogers)

For much of my life, I had what I now call small-m meanings that I aspired to, worked towards, and achieved. Some were about personal meaning and fulfillment, like manifesting Apple approaching me with a job offer to come work for them in Cupertino. Others were contributions, like making [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) to give back to (and modernize) the web industry and its 5+ billion users. And then there were meaningful relationships, from nesting partners to special friendships and chosen family and more.

But at the end of 2017, at the end of my [[The Year of Loss|Year of Loss]], I found my capital-M Meaning: Love First, a vision to spread Love and Harmony across all of humanity for the next 1000 years. And during that [[Vision of Love First]] experience, I saw all my skills, expertise, passions, interests, and desires come together in one cohesive picture of the future, the rest of my life, my _Mission_. Capital M.

Love First was what I was going to devote the entire rest of my life to. Something I was choosing to devote myself to until my final breath because I saw the transformative power of it so clearly, and because I truly believe in a story of a more beautiful world that we can write when we do so _together_, consciously and intentionally.

So now this is my Mission in life, my [[North Star]]:

To invent social, cognitive, and technological tools and solutions that catalyze new approaches to governance, harmony, and social and environmental stewardship.

To bring together people, communities, and movements in a uniting story of humanity in a Revolution of Love.

To spread Love and Harmony across all of humanity for the next 1000 years.

To get 9.94 million Americans and 224 million people worldwide to _[[Go Love First]]_.

To be One with Love.
