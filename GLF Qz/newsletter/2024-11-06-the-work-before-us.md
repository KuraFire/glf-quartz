I could write a book with just my thoughts on this election and the past year alone; it’s just far too much to even begin to scratch the surface of. So instead I want to offer you this:

The real work, the work of our collective surviving and thriving and building a world that sustains us, rests in the healing of our inner worlds, the building of mutual aid communities, and the overcoming of our divides through new modalities and ways of being that are, very intentionally and consciously, NOT rooted in any of the modalities or behaviors of the old world.

That means no using of shame, blame, or judgement as our weapon. Love is and must be our only weapon; it holds infinite many forms, so trust that together we can find a form that works for your needs.

That means no trying to argue or reason with the mind, with facts and data and statistics. We need to feel each other’s hearts and understand the pain, anger, and fear that resides in theirs and our own.

It means becoming conscious of the narratives we create and perpetuate, both for ourselves and about others. It means connecting with our spiritual inner lives and experiencing the joy, peace, and liberation that comes with that, and allowing others to see and experience us in our fullest, most radiant light.

Love is and must be our only weapon in this revolution, because whoever you think of as “the enemy” is going to use whatever weapon you use right back at you. And Love is the only weapon that you WANT your opponent to use on you.

The only true enemy is the shadow side of our humanity, which exists in each and every one of us. Everyone, every person everywhere, is just a journey on the Möbius strip of humanity away from us.

The battle for humanity is not an us-versus-them. It’s not one where there are sides, plural. Our battle, everyone’s true battle, is not one of conquest where there is a victor and a loser.

Either we all win, or nobody wins.

Our battle is the challenge of making our collective evolution a conscious transformative process that enough people are participating in that we, together, overcome the us-versus-them modality that represents the old world of being.

Oh, and there is one more thing.

Love, as a weapon, has magic powers. Let us become witches and wizards, spellcasters and superheroes.

Let’s get to work.
