Dear reader,

You’ve probably heard the term ‘normie’ and, if you’ve used it yourself, I would like to offer you a better alternative.

‘Normie’ describes people who are ‘normal’ but, typically, it’s used to describe people who are a little more generic, who dress in common mainstream ways, listen to conventional music, don’t have very eclectic tastes, and so forth. As such, it’s a somewhat derogatory term.

It also creates separation. Worse, it creates a separate group identity about people who don’t even have a say in it themselves, and who typically don’t self-identify that way. And that’s quite rude.

Now to be transparent, I myself have used this term, both to describe others _and_ myself from the past. After I had a transcendental vision at the end of 2017 and embarked on a major life transformation, everything in my life changed dramatically for the better, and became much more magical. And I’ve described my prior self as being “in my normie days”, whereas now, multiple people in my life have spontaneously called me a Magical Creature, just for being so authentically myself.

And I think this kind of magical life transformation is available to anyone.

So, instead of the term ‘normie’ I now say ‘pre-magical’; as in, “those were my pre-magical days” (describing myself pre-2017), or “they’re a more pre-magical crowd” (describing others).

Because I truly believe that _everyone_ has magic inside them, and is capable of unlocking and discovering that magic—if they are interested in doing so. Not everyone needs to be, but at least describing someone as “pre-magical” does not create some kind of wall of separation that judges them. It says that you believe in their inner magic even if they don’t, or haven’t found it yet. As well, it unites us all as one people; not as wizards versus muggles, but as human beings who all have some magic within.

If you're curious to learn more and you’re attending Burning Man this year, come to the Nest of Magical Creatures at 4:30 & C for a workshop on Becoming A Magical Creature! _(Friday 8/30 at 4:00 PM)_

With Love and Magic,

Faruk
